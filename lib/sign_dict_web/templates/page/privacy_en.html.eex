    <p>
      For us the protection of your privacy is very important. We will never
      disclose your data to a third party and obey the strict German privacy
      laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usage of this website is possible without giving us any
      data. If you enter personal data it is always by choice and
      we will never force you to do so. We will never hand over
      your data to a third party without your consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should point out that data transmission on the internet (for example
      using E-Mail) can be compromised. A complete protection can't be
      guaranteed.

    <h2>Server-Log-Files</h2>

    <p>
      The provider of this page stores some data in so called server log files.
      Those files will include data your browser will send to us automatically.
      For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>used operating system</li>
      <li>Referrer</li>
      <li>URL</li>
      <li>Host name of your computer</li>
      <li>Time and date of your request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is not assignable to a specific person. There is no
      consolidation with data from other sources that would make this
      possible. We will check the log files if we have concrete evidence
      for illegal usage of the site.
    </p>
