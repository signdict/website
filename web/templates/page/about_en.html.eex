    <h1>What is SignDict?</h1>
    <p>
      This project is an open sign language dictionary.
      Is there a sign missing, or do you know another sign for the word? Record and add it with one click.
      The only thing you need for this is your own webcam.
    </p>

      This project is funded by the <a href="https://prototypefund.de">Prototype Fund</a>.
      Development started on March 1, 2017.

    <h1>Who is the target audience?</h1>
    <p>
      This dictionary is aimed at people already fluent and to learners.
      It will be a dictionary and learning aid and will raise
      awareness of sign language in public spaces.
    </p>
    <h1>Why do we need this?</h1>
    <p>
      The goal is to create the first interactive sign language dictionary in which
      everyone can participate without the need for technical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you search for online sign language dictionaries, you will find a few.
      Sadly, most of them only have a few hundred words and donâ€™t allow users to add new signs.
      Additionally, only a few show more than one sign per word.
      I want to try to have as many sign variations for a word as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to the idea of crowdsourcing the dictionary. Everyone can participate and add a sign.
      Most computers nowadays have a webcam with a high enough quality that is sufficient to record sign language.
      Together, we as the sign language community can build an interactive dictionary, one that has as many signs as possible.
      In the beginning the dictionary will only be equipped for German sign language (DGS), but we will add more languages as we grow.

      I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_deaf_adult">CODA</a>, a child of deaf adults.
      From the moment I first saw an online video, I started dreaming of a service like this one.
      In 2013 I wrote a <a href="http://bitboxer.de/2013/10/25/see-me-speak/">proof of concept</a> with a few friends during a hackathon.
      One of the learnings back then was that the web technology was not yet good enough to build the type of application that I wanted.
      Luckily, those problems have since been solved and I can start building SignDict.
