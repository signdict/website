# SignDict.org

A crowdsourced sign language dictionary.

Here we will work on SignDict. A sign language dictionary
where registered users can add new signs using their webcam.
With the crowdsourcing approach we can create the most accurate
and largest German sign language dictionary together.

**You want to help?** Awesome. Scroll through the issues, open a new one, join our [Gitter Community](https://gitter.im/signdict/Lobby) or just send

We also offer an [API](https://github.com/signdict/website/wiki/API).

## Development setup

SignDict uses Elixir and Phoenix. Information on how
to install Elixir can be found [here](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

For the video transcoding it uses [redis](http://redis.io). On
mac, install it via `brew install redis-server`, or `sudo apt install redis-server` for Linux and start it.

As database it uses [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org).

After you installed everything, the setup is as follows:

### Mac instructions:

```bash
mix ua_inspector.download
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup
cd assets/ && yarn install && cd ..
mix phx.server
```

### Linux instructions:

Note: If you run into postgres password authentication errors, check out [this blogpost for help](https://juwondaniel.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/solve-mix-ecto-create-postgresql-password-issue-with-phoenix/).

```bash
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g yarn
cd assets/ && yarn install && cd ..
mix phx.server
```

### Docker instructions:

First, make the PostgreSQL and redis servers point to the docker services. Change `hostname: "localhost"` to `hostname: "db"` in `config/dev.exs`, and add `host: "redis"` to the `:exq` section in `config/config.exs`.

Then run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

to install all dependencies and start the PostgreSQL, redis and web server services (including code reloading). The website is available at http://localhost:4000.

With that you have a running system and a default admin user called
`admin@example.com` with the password `thepasswordisalie`.

Before you contribute code, please make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

In development mode `Bamboo` will not sent emails. Instead you can see what
would have been sent out here: `http://localhost:4000/sent_emails`

This project is using [yarn](http://yarnjs.com/) for javascript dependency management.

You can also use the included `Procfile` to start redis and the phoenix server at
the same time. Install `foreman` with `gem install foreman` and execute `foreman start`
to have both started automatically.

### How to run the suite

```bash
mix test
```

## Deployment

The server is configured using [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) with [this playbook](/ansible/playbook.yml) and can be updated with:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml -i ansible/hosts --extra-vars '{"username": "******"}'
```

The system is currently using [bootleg](https://github.com/labzero/bootleg) to
deploy the app. Simply call `bootleg_user=USERNAME mix bootleg.update` to
deploy it to the production environment.

## Importing files manually

You can import a file using a json file with `mix importer file.json`. The json should have [this](test/fixtures/videos/Zug.json) format.

## Funding

This project is government funded by the [German Federal Ministry of Education and Research](http://bmbf.de)
and is part of the 1st batch of the [prototype fund](http://prototypefund.de).
